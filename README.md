# Combine CSV Files with Randomized IDs

This project provides a Python script to combine multiple CSV files from a specified folder into a single CSV and Excel file. The script includes additional features to enhance the combined data:

- **Source File Tracking**: Adds a new column indicating the source file name for each row.
- **Randomized Unique IDs**: Assigns a unique numeric ID to each row in a random order.

The output files are saved as both `.csv` and `.xlsx` formats for compatibility with different use cases.

This script is ideal for automating the merging of CSV data while preserving file origins and adding randomized identifiers.
