# Python CSV File Merger

This project is a simple yet robust tool for merging multiple CSV files into a single file. Designed to automate and enhance CSV file handling, the script allows for streamlined data combination, file origin tracking, and the assignment of randomized unique IDs.

## Features
- Combine multiple CSV files from a specified folder into a single CSV and Excel file.
- Automatically tracks the source file for each row by adding a "Source File" column.
- Generates randomized unique IDs for each row to ensure distinct entries.
- Supports `.csv` and `.xlsx` output formats for broad compatibility.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later must be installed on your system.
- Required Python libraries: `pandas`, `openpyxl`.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the project repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Create the Input Folder**  
   Inside the project directory, create a folder named `input_csv_folder`:
   ```bash
   mkdir input_csv_folder
   ```
   Place all your `.csv` files inside this folder.

3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**  
   Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required libraries using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas openpyxl
   ```

### Usage

Run the script with the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

The script will:
1. Read all `.csv` files in the `input_csv_folder` directory.
2. Merge their contents while reorganizing columns into a specified order.
3. Add a "Source File" column indicating the origin of each row.
4. Generate randomized unique IDs for each row.
5. Save the combined data as:
   - `combined_ideas.csv`
   - `combined_ideas.xlsx`

### Notes
- To customize the order of columns, modify the `columns_to_merge` list in the script.
- The random IDs are generated to ensure uniqueness and are randomized in order.

### Example

1. Place `.csv` files in the `input_csv_folder` directory:
   ```
   input_csv_folder/
   â”œâ”€â”€ data1.csv
   â”œâ”€â”€ data2.csv
   â””â”€â”€ data3.csv
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

3. The output will be saved as:
   ```
   combined_ideas.csv
   combined_ideas.xlsx
   ```
